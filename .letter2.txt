Thank you so much for delivering that message for him!
I've always thought he was cute.

Please give him this envelope by using the mv command.
The mv command moves a file from one place to another

the location of the file, followed by the destination
of the file. In this case all you have to type is:
mv myInventory/Envelope manInventory/Envelope
