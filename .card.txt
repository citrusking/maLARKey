Hello! I am terribly sorry if I have been any trouble to you.
I lost my hearing before I could even walk due to a disease.
If you have something you must tell me, please write it down
for me using Linux.

To write me a letter, simply use redirection!
All you have to do is echo your message then follow that
with the '>' sign. This is the sign for redirection
of output. It will send the Linux output wherever you want.
Please make sure to put the letter in my inventory by
using the syntax: echo "message" > ladyInventory/letter.txt
