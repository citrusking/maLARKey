Hi! It's great to see you again! How are you?
I was just thinking about how you used the
Linux redirection syntax to write me a letter.
It reminded me that there's a similar syntax
within Linux for appending! That way, you can
add text to a file without overwriting it!
The syntax is super simple: you just have to
use two redirection symbols, in other words:
just use '>>'!

(DEV NOTE: Appending does not work in-game
for coding reasons. I had to specifically
code in the redirection for earlier.)
