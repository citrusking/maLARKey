I'm writing this note so that you can keep it with you
and you'll know what to do if your friend loses their
memory again.

First, explain where they are and who you are. That
will help comfort them. Next, they'll need to know how
to use Linux to help jog their memory. Make sure you
explain enough for them to be able to use at least the
basics of Linux. The doctor says that this should only
be temporary, so just be patient with your friend, okay?

Love, Mom.
